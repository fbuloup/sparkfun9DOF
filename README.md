# Sparkfun 9DOF configuration and test

Sparkfun 9DOF is an inertial measurement unit with nine degrees of freedom. It includes three kinds of sensors :

1. accelerometer
2. gyroscope
3. magnetometer

Sensors give informations along the three space axis.

This repository show how to configure and use this IMU. To reproduce these tests, just follow these  three steps :

1. [Installation under Windows](https://github.com/fbuloup/sparkfun9DOF/tree/master/1_WindowsInstallation)
2. [Installation of Jupyter](https://github.com/fbuloup/sparkfun9DOF/tree/master/2_Jupyter)
3. [Acquire data with IMU](https://github.com/fbuloup/sparkfun9DOF/tree/master/3_IMU_DACQ)

If your are using OSX or Linux, just replace step 1 with step 4. Step 5 allows you to configure charts for Jupyter notebook. Step 6 show two small matlab scipts.
